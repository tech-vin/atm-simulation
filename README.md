# ATM Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates an ATM system, allowing users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing and depositing money, viewing a mini statement, and managing their PIN securely. The project will evolve through several stages, improving in complexity and functionality.

## Project Stages

1. **Functional Version**: A simple command-line ATM simulation using functional programming principles.
2. **Class-Based Version**: Refactor the functional code into a class-based structure for better organization and scalability.
3. **File Integration**: Read/Write operations using file.
4. **Database Integration**: Incorporate a database to store user data, transactions, and account information securely.
4. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI) for interacting with the ATM system.

## Features

- User authentication with a PIN.
- Withdraw and deposit money.
- View mini statements showing transaction history.
- Change Pin.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- SQLite
- UI framework: Tkinter

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- (Optional) A virtual environment setup if you prefer to isolate dependencies.

### Installation
